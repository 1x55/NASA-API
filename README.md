## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API
Users can also interact with a 'Lift Off' button to retrieve media from a different random date, providing a new experience every time the button is clicked. Additionally, the 'Explore' section enables users to enter a specific date, and the app fetches the corresponding image or video from NASA's APOD database.

## Lessons Learned:

I was able to practice and become more familiar with API usage through the process of appending DOM elements with the data that was returned from using the Fetch API. Using Javascript, I was also able to manipulate the range of dates that the data would be pulled from. Additionally, I accounted for dates that do not provide any media.
